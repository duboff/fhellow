Makers Academy Hackathon Project

This is an unfinished application made during a hackathon weekend. The application runs on Node.js using orchestrate.io as a database. Bootstrap and Gmaps.js are used on the front end.

Currently the application's front end and back-end are not connected properly. However, both are working separately and finishing the app would not require too much additional time if the project is picked up.

The app was developed in a different version control system and thus full commit history is not available on Github. It was also not written in a TDD way due to timing. It is presented here as a showcase and for later reference.
