Makers Academy Hackathon Project

This is an unfinished application made during a hackathon weekend. The application runs on Node.js using orchestrate.io as a database. Bootstrap and Gmaps.js are used on the front end.

Currently the application's front end and back-end are not connected properly. However, both are working separately and finishing the app would not require too much additional time if the project is picked up.
